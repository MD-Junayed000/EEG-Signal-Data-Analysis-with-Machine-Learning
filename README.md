EEG Data Analysis and Alcoholism Detection
This project focuses on analyzing EEG (electroencephalogram) data to classify subjects as alcoholic or control using signal processing and machine learning techniques.
📂 Dataset Overview
The EEG dataset consists of signals recorded from multiple electrodes over time for two groups:
•	Alcoholic Group
•	Control Group
Each sample represents brain activity captured over time, providing insights into neural patterns associated with alcoholism.
🔧 Approach
1. Signal Processing
•	Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT): Used to examine time-frequency characteristics of EEG signals. The CWT allowed us to analyze the signal variations over different frequency bands and time intervals.
•	Fourier Transform (FFT): Applied to convert the time-domain EEG signals into the frequency domain, giving a spectral view of the data.
2. Visualization
•	Plotted the original EEG signals, wavelet scaleograms, and Fourier Transform power spectra to gain insights into how EEG patterns differ between alcoholic and control subjects.
3. Machine Learning
•	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Trained on the EEG data to classify subjects into alcoholic and control groups.
•	Support Vector Machine (SVM): Used to improve classification accuracy by leveraging the distinct EEG features in both groups.
⚙️ Technologies Used
•	Python (NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, PyWavelets, SciPy, Scikit-learn)
•	Signal Processing Techniques (CWT, FFT)
•	Machine Learning (KNN, SVM)
📝 Results
•	KNN Classifier: Achieved a high classification accuracy (~99%), with strong recall and precision for both groups.
•	SVM Classifier: Further improved classification, achieving reliable separation of alcoholic and control subjects based on EEG features.
📊 Visualizations
•	EEG signals, wavelet scaleograms, and Fourier Transform power spectra are all included in the project to aid in understanding how EEG patterns relate to alcoholism.
