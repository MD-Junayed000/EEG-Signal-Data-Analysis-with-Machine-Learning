**EEG Data Analysis and Alcoholism Detection**

This project focuses on analyzing EEG (electroencephalogram) data to classify subjects as alcoholic or control using signal processing and machine learning techniques.

üìÇ **Dataset Overview**

The EEG dataset consists of signals recorded from multiple electrodes over time for two groups:

‚Ä¢	**Alcoholic Group**

‚Ä¢	**Control Group**

Each sample represents brain activity captured over time, providing insights into neural patterns associated with alcoholism.

üîß **Approach**

**1. Signal Processing**

‚Ä¢		Analyze EEG data for classifying subjects into alcoholic and control groups according to subject experimented each electrode channel sensor value; sampled at 256 Hz.


**2. Visualization**

‚Ä¢	Plotted the original EEG signals and Filtered EEG signal with Butterworth Bandpass filter to remove noise and artifacts in-order to gain insights into how EEG patterns differ between alcoholic and control subjects.

**3. Machine Learning**

**‚Ä¢	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Trained on the EEG data to classify subjects into alcoholic and control groups.

**‚Ä¢	Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Used to improve classification accuracy by leveraging the distinct EEG features in both groups.

**‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used**

‚Ä¢	Python (NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, PyWavelets, SciPy, Scikit-learn)
‚Ä¢	Signal Filtering Technique 
‚Ä¢	Machine Learning (KNN, SVM)

**üìù Results**

**‚Ä¢	KNN Classifier:** Achieved a high classification accuracy (~99%), with strong recall and precision for both groups.
**‚Ä¢	SVM Classifier:** Further improved classification, achieving reliable separation of alcoholic and control subjects based on EEG features.

**üìä Visualizations**
‚Ä¢	Filtered EEG signals to aid in understanding how EEG patterns relate to alcoholism.
